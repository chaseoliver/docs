Designers have always been more curator than creator. Inspired by the latest trends and the desire to simply do better, they blend disparate patterns into cohesive experiences that feel both empowering and intentional.

The way we design for AI should be no different. The best experiences with AI are not generated but curated.

Though more and more of those experiences will become less visible to the user, they are nonetheless crafted by those with skin in the game who use specific desired outcomes to elevate what AI makes possible.

Built on the belief that nothing is more powerful than humans and AI working together, we aim to provide tools that lead to better, more curated AI experiences. When done right users won't notice or care about the technology that powers it; they'll simply think it was them that did it.
