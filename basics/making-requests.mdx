## Request

### System prompt

Set context and limitations that help AI generate a successful response.

```
You are a helpful assistant.
```

### User prompt

This is what either you or the user is requesting from AI. It helps to be as specific as you can.

```
I need help setting up my wifi. Can you give me step by step instructions?
```
