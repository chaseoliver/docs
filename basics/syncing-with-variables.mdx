Figma variables allow you to alter the state of components and change the content displayed in your design based on an AI response.

## Defining local variables

Start by defining local variables. Currently only text Figma variables are supported, which can be used to sync both text and variables.

<Tip>Create a local variables collection for AI to stay organized and make data easier to sync.</Tip>

## Creating component variants

Create a component with variants that match your variables.

## Structuring response data to match variants

The "answer" property defines expected values that can be read by our component.

## Sync response your variable

Once you have a response, click on the value you want to apply and then select the variable from the "Apply to" dropdown and click "Sync".
