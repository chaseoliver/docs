Designers have always been more curator than creator. Inspired by the latest trends and the innate desire to *simply do better*, they blend disparate patterns into cohesive experiences that empower users and feel intentional.

The way we design for AI should be no different; the best AI products are not generated but curated. Though the way we experience them will become less visible over time they are nonetheless crafted by designers who elevate what AI makes possible in order to make a positive impact on peoples lives.

Nothing is more powerful than humans and AI working together. We aim to provide tools that lead to more curated AI experiences that feel so natural users don't think about the technology powers it; they'll simply think it was them that did it.

That's AI by design.
