Designers have always been more curator than creator. Inspired by the latest trends and the desire to simply do better, they blend disparate patterns into cohesive experiences that feel both empowering and intentional.

The way we design for AI should be no different; the best AI experiences are not generated but curated. Though more of those experiences will become less visible they are nonetheless crafted by those with skin in the game to elevate what AI makes possible.

Nothing is more powerful than humans and AI working together. We aim to provide tools that lead to more curated AI experiences that feel so natural users don't think about the technology powers it; they'll simply think it was them that did it.

That's AI by design.
